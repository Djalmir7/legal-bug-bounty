# Release copyright in the bug bounty policy 

When you are "updating" your VDP/bug bounty policy, you might be doing great stuff for the community that me and others might want to use, depending on the language. Please consider to follow Dropbox and release the copyright rights (to the extent existing) in your policy, to encourage"uniform security best practices". Here is a proposed language, from Dropbox: 

> "In order to encourage the adoption of bug bounty programs and promote uniform security best practices across the industry, we reserve no rights in this bug bounty policy and so you are free to copy and modify it for your own purposes."
